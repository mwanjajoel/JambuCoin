#  JambuCoin

Now before you think this is another cryptocurrency, hold that thought.... its not. ðŸ¤“. Great, now that we are past that, moving on. 

JambuCoin is an iOS application that demonstrates the use of blockchain technology. Its written in Swift programming language. 

## Simple Intro to BlockChain 

BlockChain is a technology that is behind the success of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. 
It comprises of blocks put together to form  a "chain of blocks" or a block chain 

### What is in a block?

A block contains three vital pieces 

* Data 
* Hash 
* Previous Block's Hash 

The Data can be anything you want to store, eg. for the case of Bitcoin, its the transaction data like the amount and the two entities transacting etc. 

The hash is the digital footprint, usually 64 alpha-numeric characters that uniquely identifies a block. Once a block is modified, the hash changes. 

Previous block's hash is the "glue" between the current block and the previous one. Once this is changed, the block cant recognise the previous one thus the chain is broken. 

This simply means by storing the hash of the previous block, its hard for hackers to hack into this block chain. How ðŸ¤” you might ask. Once the hash of any previous block is changed, the current block cant recognise it thus making the data in the current block inaccessible. 

Other measures to ensure the security of blockchain is to use smart contracts and proof-of-work. You can always Google them to find out more ðŸ˜ƒ

## What this App does 

JambuCoin simply demonstrates the concept of blockchain without the algorithms and other concepts. 

Its not a wallet, nor is it some sort of Crytocurrency..... yet ðŸ˜Ž
